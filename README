I haven't coded for a long time. It's time to code something.
### What is it
It's a game about choice, how to keep your government remaining in power, and how to keep alive...
### Motivation
I'm having a course about History of Taiwan after WWII, and I feel atounished when I heard about what KMT(╟Й╔адр) did in that period. So I decided to make a little game about some horrible incidents that did actually happen but I knew nothing about.
